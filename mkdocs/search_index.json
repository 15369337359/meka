In \nmulti-label classification\n, \nwe want to predict multiple output variables for each input instance. This different from the \n'standard' case (binary, or multi-class classification) which involves only a \nsingle target variable. MEKA is based on the \nWEKA\n \nMachine Learning Toolkit; it includes dozens of multi-label methods from the scientific literature, \nas well as a wrapper to the related \nMULAN\n framework.\n\n\nMain developers\n\n\n\n\nJesse Read\n (Ecole Polytechnique, France)\n\n\nPeter Reutemann\n (University of Waikato, New Zealand)\n\n\nJoerg Wicker\n (University of Auckland, New Zealand)\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots",
