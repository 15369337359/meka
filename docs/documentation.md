To get started, [download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/meka/files/) 
MEKA and run `./run.sh` (`run.bat` on Windows) to launch the GUI.

The [MEKA tutorial (pdf)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/meka/files/meka-1.9.1/Tutorial.pdf) 
has numerous examples on how to run and extend MEKA.

See the list of methods available in MEKA, and (command-line) examples on how to use them.

There are some [examples](https://github.com/Waikato/meka/tree/master/src/main/java/mekaexamples) 
on how to use Meka in your Java code.

The [API reference](http://meka.sourceforge.net/api-1.9/index.html) is available.

MEKA originated from implementations of work from various [publications](http://jmread.github.io/publications.html) 
(note also the references therein). There are some [tutorials/slides](http://jmread.github.io/talks.html) 
about multi-label and multi-target classification in general.

(please avoid contacting developers directly for MEKA-related help).
